## 1. mem0 Platform Architecture

### Overview

[mem0.ai](https://mem0.ai) is an LLM-powered memory management layer by Embedchain, Inc. (Y Combinator-backed). The core team includes Deshraj Yadav (Co-founder/CTO, ex-Tesla Senior Autopilot Engineer), Prateek Chhikara, Dev Khant, Taranjeet Singh, and Saket Aryan.

- **GitHub:** [mem0ai/mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) — 47.7k+ stars, Apache 2.0 license
- **npm plugin:** `@mem0/openclaw-mem0` v0.1.0 (published Feb 5, 2026)
- **Research paper:** Published on the platform's memory extraction approach

### Data Flow Pipeline

```
User message
  → OpenClaw before_agent_start hook (auto-recall)
    → mem0 searches existing memories for relevant context
    → Injects retrieved memories as prependContext
  → LLM processes message with memory context
  → OpenClaw post-response hook (auto-capture)
    → mem0 extraction pipeline:
      1. LLM extracts candidate "memories" from conversation
      2. Conflict resolution against existing memories (update/merge/discard)
      3. Embedding generation for vector storage
      4. Storage in vector DB (Qdrant) + graph DB (Neo4j, optional)
```

### Plugin Tools Exposed

The OpenClaw plugin registers 5 memory tools + 2 CLI commands:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_search` | Query memories by semantic similarity |
| `memory_store` | Manually store a memory |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve specific memory by ID |
| `memory_list` | List all memories for a user/agent |
| `memory_forget` | Delete a specific memory |
| `mem0 search` (CLI) | Search from command line |
| `mem0 stats` (CLI) | View memory statistics |

### Lifecycle Hooks

- **`before_agent_start`** — auto-recall: searches mem0 for relevant context before each LLM call
- **Post-response** — auto-capture: processes every agent response to extract durable memories

### Dependencies

Minimal dependency tree:
- `@sinclair/typebox` v0.34.47 (schema validation — low risk)
- `mem0ai` ^2.2.1 (the actual Mem0 SDK)

## 2. mem0 vs Built-in Memory Comparison

| Dimension | Built-in (Current) | mem0 Plugin |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Storage** | SQLite + sqlite-vec (local) | Qdrant + Neo4j (self-hosted or cloud) |
| **Search** | Hybrid: vector 0.7 + BM25 0.3 | Vector similarity + optional graph traversal |
| **Embeddings** | embeddinggemma-300m (local, 384-dim) | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cloud) or Ollama (Python SDK only) |
| **Auto-recall** | Automatic per-message retrieval | `before_agent_start` hook injection |
| **Auto-capture** | Pre-compaction flush at ~176K tokens | Every response processed for extraction |
| **Privacy** | 100% local, zero data leaves VPS | Cloud: data to mem0 servers + LLM providers. Self-hosted: local but complex |
| **Cost** | $0 (local embeddings) | Cloud: $0.001/memory + LLM costs. Self-hosted: infrastructure overhead |
| **Maturity** | Production-stable in OpenClaw | v0.1.0, zero npm dependents, critical bug fixed 3 days ago |
| **GDPR** | Full control (your data, your VPS) | Cloud: no public DPA, SOC 2 Type II pending. Self-hosted: your responsibility |
| **Complexity** | Zero config beyond existing setup | Requires Qdrant + Neo4j (self-hosted) or API key (cloud) |

### Key Differentiator

mem0's main value-add is **continuous memory extraction** — it processes every conversation exchange to identify and store discrete "memories." The built-in system captures memories via pre-compaction flush (triggered at ~88% context window capacity) and workspace files (MEMORY.md, daily logs).

The trade-off: mem0 captures more granularly but at the cost of processing every message through an extraction LLM. The built-in system captures less frequently but with zero additional LLM calls.

## 3. Security Vetting Checklist

### 3.1 Author Known/Trusted?

**PASS — Legitimate Y Combinator company.**

- Embedchain, Inc. — verifiable founders with professional histories
- Deshraj Yadav: ex-Tesla Senior Autopilot Engineer
- Active open-source development, 47.7k GitHub stars
- Multiple LLM platform integrations (not OpenClaw-only)

### 3.2 Downloads > 1,000?

**FAIL — v0.1.0 with zero community adoption.**

- Published Feb 5, 2026 (15 days before research)
- Zero other npm dependents
- Would be first production user of this specific plugin

### 3.3 VirusTotal Clean?

**PASS — No flags.**

- Not mentioned in VirusTotal's Feb 2026 ClawHub malware analysis (which covered 3,016+ skills)
- No CVEs filed against mem0 platform
- OpenClaw has since [announced VirusTotal scanning integration](https://openclaw.ai/blog/virustotal-partnership) for ClawHub uploads

### 3.4 ClawHavoc Association?

**PASS — No connection.**

- hightower6eu (ClawHavoc) uploaded 314-677 malicious packages targeting crypto/finance
- mem0ai is a separate organization with years of history
- Completely different publisher, distribution model, and code patterns

### 3.5 Source Code Review?

**PASS — Clean code, no red flags.**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `eval()` | None |
| `exec()` | None |
| `fetch()` to unknown hosts | None — connects only to configured mem0 endpoint |
| Obfuscated code | None — readable TypeScript |
| npm lifecycle scripts | **None** — no preinstall/postinstall/install scripts |
| Shell commands | None |
| Data exfiltration | No covert channels — all data transmission explicit |

Positive design patterns observed:
- Environment variable validation with explicit error messages
- Config schema enforcement preventing injection
- Strips injected memory context before capture (prevents recursive memory pollution)
- Clean error handling throughout

### 3.6 Requires Denied Tools?

**PASS — Memory tools only.**

Registers `memory_search`, `memory_store`, `memory_get`, `memory_list`, `memory_forget`. None conflict with denied list `[gateway, nodes, sessions_spawn, sessions_send]`.

Note: `autoCapture` silently processes every agent response — by design, not a vulnerability, but worth understanding.

### 3.7 Version Pinning Possible?

**PARTIAL — Plugin yes, SDK dependency uses semver range.**

- Plugin: can pin `@mem0/openclaw-mem0@0.1.0`
- SDK: `mem0ai` dependency uses `^2.2.1` (could pull newer minor/patch versions)
- For maximum security: fork and lock to exact version, or use lockfile

### 3.8 GDPR Compliant?

**UNKNOWN — Significant documentation gaps.**

What mem0 claims:
- SOC 2 Type I certified (Type II in progress)
- HIPAA-ready, BYOK encryption, zero-trust access controls

What is NOT documented:
- No explicit GDPR compliance statement
- No data retention period specified
- No data deletion procedure documented
- No Data Processing Agreement (DPA) publicly available
- Privacy policy by "Embedchain, Inc." acknowledges sharing with OpenAI/Anthropic as third-party processors

**Self-hosted mode makes GDPR your responsibility** (actually preferable — full control).

### Verdict Summary

| Criterion | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Author trusted | PASS |
| Downloads > 1,000 | **FAIL** |
| VirusTotal clean | PASS |
| ClawHavoc association | PASS |
| Source code clean | PASS |
| Requires denied tools | PASS |
| Version pinning | PARTIAL |
| GDPR compliant | **UNKNOWN** |

## 4. Self-Hosting vs Cloud Analysis

### Cloud Mode (mem0 Platform)

- **Pros:** Zero infrastructure, managed Qdrant, automatic scaling
- **Cons:** All conversation data leaves VPS → mem0 servers → LLM providers
- **Cost:** $0.001/memory + LLM embedding/extraction costs
- **GDPR risk:** US-based company, no public DPA, VPS is in Germany

### Self-Hosted Mode (OSS)

- **Architecture:** Qdrant (vector DB) + Ollama (embeddings) + optional Neo4j (graph)
- **Pros:** Data stays on VPS, full control
- **Critical blocker:** The **TypeScript SDK only supports OpenAI embeddings** — Ollama integration is Python SDK only
- **Impact:** Self-hosted local-only is impossible without switching to the Python SDK or waiting for TS SDK updates
- **Infrastructure overhead:** Qdrant + Neo4j + Ollama = significant additional services on a 24GB VPS already running OpenClaw

### Conclusion

Neither mode is practical:
- Cloud mode violates the "data stays local" principle
- Self-hosted mode has a TypeScript SDK limitation that makes local embeddings impossible

---

## 5. Alternative Plugins and Approaches

### 5.1 QMD Backend (Built-in)

The most promising upgrade path. OpenClaw's QMD (Query-Model-Document) backend replaces the default SQLite search with:

- **BM25 + vector search + reranking sidecar**
- Fully local via Bun + node-llama-cpp
- Config: `memory.backend: "qmd"`
- No external services required
- Reranking improves retrieval quality beyond simple hybrid search

### 5.2 memory-lancedb (Bundled Extension)

A bundled OpenClaw extension (not a ClawHub community package):

- **LanceDB** vector database + OpenAI embeddings
- Built-in **prompt injection filtering** on retrieved memories
- Auto-recall and auto-capture hooks
- Ships with OpenClaw — no supply chain risk

### 5.3 Built-in Memory Optimization

Features already available that match mem0's capabilities:

| Feature | Config Key | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Pre-compaction memory flush | `memoryFlush.enabled: true` | Available, verify enabled |
| Embedding cache | `embedding.cache.enabled: true`, `maxEntries: 50000` | Available |
| Hybrid search tuning | `vectorWeight`, `textWeight`, `minScore` | Currently: 0.7/0.3/0.35 |
| Temporal decay | 30-day half-life (default) | Active |
| MMR diversity | Prevents redundant retrievals | Active |
| Daily workspace logs | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Auto-loaded (today + yesterday) |

### 5.4 ClawHub Community Options (NOT Recommended)

Several community plugins exist on ClawHub for memory management. Per our security posture (bundled skills only, zero ClawHub community installs), these are documented but not recommended:

- Various `memory-*` packages with low download counts
- Supply chain risk on a marketplace recently compromised by ClawHavoc (1,184 malicious packages)

---

## 6. Recommendation: 3-Tier Optimization Strategy

### Decision: DO NOT INSTALL mem0

Not because it's malicious (it's not), but because:

1. **Unnecessary** — built-in memory already covers everything mem0 offers, locally
2. **Too early** — v0.1.0, zero adoption, critical auto-recall bug (#4037) only fixed Feb 17
3. **TypeScript limitation** — self-hosted OSS can't use local embeddings from TS SDK
4. **GDPR exposure** — cloud mode + German VPS + no public DPA = compliance risk
5. **Philosophy mismatch** — capability-neutral but security-negative

### 3-Tier Strategy

#### Tier 1: Optimize Built-in (Now, ~15 min)

- Enable `memoryFlush.enabled: true` if not already active
- Enable `embedding.cache.enabled: true` with `maxEntries: 50000`
- Tune `minScore` — test values between 0.25-0.45 for optimal recall/precision
- Verify pre-compaction flush is triggering properly

#### Tier 2: QMD Backend (When memory quality needs improvement)

- Switch to `memory.backend: "qmd"` for BM25 + vector + reranking
- Fully local, no external dependencies
- Estimated effort: ~1 hour for migration and testing
- Monitor retrieval quality before and after

#### Tier 3: Revisit mem0 (Future, when conditions change)

Wait for:
- mem0 v0.2+ with community adoption > 1,000 npm dependents
- TypeScript SDK supporting Ollama/local embeddings
- Published GDPR DPA from Embedchain, Inc.
- At least 3 months of production stability reports from other OpenClaw users

## 7. OpenClaw Built-in Memory Architecture

Understanding the built-in memory system in depth reinforces the "optimize built-in first" strategy from Tier 1 above. This section synthesizes findings from the [OpenClaw Memory System Deep Dive](https://snowan.gitbook.io/study-notes/ai-blogs/openclaw-memory-system-deep-dive) by snowan.

### Three-Tier Memory Model

| Tier | Storage | Lifecycle | Example |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Ephemeral** | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily logs, auto-created | Today's conversation notes, tool outputs |
| **Durable** | `MEMORY.md` (workspace) | Curated, long-lived | Key facts, preferences, project context |
| **Session** | `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` | Per-session transcripts | Full conversation archives |

Ephemeral files accumulate daily and are indexed into the SQLite database. Durable memory lives in workspace (injected every message). Session files are indexed but not brute-force injected.

### SQLite Indexing Architecture

The `MemoryIndexManager` class orchestrates all memory operations:

- **FTS5 virtual tables** provide BM25 full-text search with tokenized indexing
- **Vector columns** store embeddings alongside text for hybrid retrieval
- **Chunking algorithm:** ~400-token chunks with ~80-token overlap, splitting on semantic boundaries (headers, paragraphs, code blocks)
- **Delta-based sync:** Only re-indexes chunks that changed since last sync — tracks file modification times and content hashes to avoid redundant embedding calls

### Embedding Provider Chain

Auto-selection with fallback:

1. **Local model** (e.g., embeddinggemma-300m) — preferred for privacy and zero cost
2. **OpenAI** — cloud fallback if local unavailable
3. **Gemini** — secondary cloud fallback

Batch optimization reduces embedding API costs by ~50% when using cloud providers (batches of 50+ chunks sent in single API calls rather than one-by-one).

### Pre-Compaction Memory Flush

Critical for information preservation:

1. When context window approaches capacity (~88%), the system detects impending compaction
2. Before compaction triggers, important context is flushed to memory files (ephemeral tier)
3. Compaction then summarizes older conversation turns, reducing context size
4. The flushed content survives in memory and can be retrieved by future searches

This means the system doesn't just discard old context — it saves what matters first, then compresses.

### Implications for Optimization

- **Embedding cache** (`embedding.cache.enabled: true`) avoids redundant embedding calls for previously-indexed chunks
- **minScore tuning** directly affects recall/precision tradeoff — lower values retrieve more but less relevant chunks
- **QMD backend** (Tier 2 upgrade path) adds reranking on top of the existing BM25 + vector pipeline
- **Daily memory files** grow unbounded — the backup script's pruning of old reports (Tier 1) should extend to old daily memory files if they accumulate

## 8. PARA Implementation: Structured Flat Files

> Decision made 2026-03-07 after extensive research (9 agents, 12 dimensions, 250K+ chars). Research archive: `~/.claude/History/research/2026-03/2026-03-07_para-knowledge-graphs/`

### Decision: PARA Directories Over Knowledge Graphs

Layer PARA (Projects/Areas/Resources/Archive) directory structure on top of the existing memory-core system. No graph database. No new external dependencies.

**Why now:** Felix ($99 ClawMart persona) ships PARA + hot/warm/cold decay as a differentiator. Our research shows the pattern is well-established in production systems (MemGPT, ChatGPT, Manus) and recent literature (FadeMem Jan 2026, MAGMA, EverMemOS). But the contrarian evidence is equally strong — Manus ($2B acquisition) used 3 markdown files, ChatGPT uses plain text. The right answer at Gregor's scale (~365 daily files/year, ~240K tokens total) is structured flat files, not a graph database.

### Architecture

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/
  daily/                    # Raw daily logs (relocated from root)
    2026-03-07.md
    2026-03-06.md
  projects/                 # PARA: Active goals with deadlines (HOT)
    openclaw-bot.md
    supercolony.md
  areas/                    # PARA: Ongoing responsibilities (WARM)
    vps-ops.md
    security.md
    cost-monitoring.md
  resources/                # PARA: Reference material (WARM)
    provider-pricing.md
    cli-patterns.md
    troubleshooting.md
  archive/                  # PARA: Completed/inactive (COLD)
    2026-02/
  meta/                     # Consolidation state & scores
    importance-scores.json
    consolidation-state.json
  MEMORY.md                 # Curated long-term (unchanged)
```

memory-core indexes all `.md` files via the `memory/**/*.md` recursive glob ([Issue #25497](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/25497)), so subdirectories are transparent to search. The PARA directories add navigable organization and enable category-aware crons.

### Tier Mapping

| Tier | PARA Category | Decay Mechanism | Consolidation |
|------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Hot** | `projects/` + today's `daily/` | None | — |
| **Warm-persistent** | `areas/` | Slow — refreshed by weekly synthesis | Weekly |
| **Warm-reference** | `resources/` | Very slow — refreshed monthly | Monthly |
| **Cold** | `archive/` | Natural — never refreshed | Quarterly prune |

### Consolidation Crons

Three Haiku crons handle episodic-to-semantic consolidation (total: ~$1.18/month):

| Cron | Schedule | Purpose | Cost |
|------|----------|---------|------|
| Nightly consolidation | Daily 3AM | Extract facts from daily log → route to PARA files | ~$0.90/mo |
| Weekly synthesis | Sunday 3AM | Deduplicate, update importance scores, archive stale entries | ~$0.20/mo |
| Monthly archive pruning | 1st of month | Compress old daily files into monthly summaries | ~$0.08/mo |

### Importance-Modulated Decay (FadeMem Pattern)

Instead of implementing adaptive λ in a database, we use LLM-driven curation frequency as the decay mechanism. Important facts get consolidated forward by the nightly/weekly crons (resetting their file modification time and keeping them "fresh" to memory-core's temporal decay). Unimportant facts are never re-touched and age out naturally via the existing `halfLifeDays: 30` config.

This mirrors FadeMem's (Jan 2026) approach of importance-modulated retention — which retained 82.1% of critical facts at 55% storage — but implemented purely through file curation rather than database-level decay functions.

### Alternatives Evaluated

| Alternative | Verdict | Reason |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Neo4j knowledge graph** | Rejected | 2.7-4GB RAM overhead, overkill at Gregor's scale |
| **FalkorDB** | Rejected | Best lightweight graph but still 4GB RAM minimum |
| **Cognee** | Watch list | Best graph option, requires Python + Neo4j. Interesting if we outgrow flat files |
| **Zep/Graphiti** | Rejected | Temporal KG needs Neo4j, Python-only SDK, wrong stack |
| **memory-lancedb** | Rejected | Exclusive plugin slot — loses memory-core tools, requires external embedding API |
| **openclaw-mem sidecar** | Watch list | phenomenoner's project, unverified maturity |
| **Replace memory-core** | Never | Foundation layer, we build on top, never replace |
| **Manus-style minimal** | Inspiration | $2B acquisition with 3 markdown files validates flat-file approach |
